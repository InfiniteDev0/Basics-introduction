📘 Figma Full Notes for Designers & Developers
🔰 What is Figma?
Figma is a cloud-based UI/UX design tool used for designing websites, mobile apps, prototypes, and collaborative design systems. It runs in a browser or desktop app, allowing real-time collaboration, making it ideal for teams.

🛠️ What Can You Do With Figma?
1. User Interface (UI) Design
Design web, mobile, or desktop app interfaces

Use frames, auto-layouts, components, and grids

2. Prototyping
Link frames to create interactive flows

Add animations and transitions

Share prototypes via link

3. Wireframing
Sketch early ideas quickly

Use low-fidelity shapes and layout tools

4. Design Systems
Create reusable components (buttons, inputs, navbars)

Define color styles, text styles, spacing scales

5. Team Collaboration
Real-time co-editing

Commenting directly on designs

Version control

6. Developer Handoff
Developers can inspect elements

Get CSS/Swift/XML code

Download assets directly

🧰 Key Features
Feature	Description
Frames	Similar to artboards in Sketch/Adobe XD
Auto Layout	Makes buttons, forms, cards flexible and responsive
Components	Reusable elements like buttons and headers
Variants	Manage different states (e.g., hover, active) of components
Prototyping Tools	Create clickable flows
Design Tokens	Define consistent colors, typography, spacing
Plugins	Extend Figma's functionality (icons, illustrations, charts)

🧑‍💻 How to Use Figma (Basics)
1. Create a New File
Open figma.com

Click “New Design File”

2. Draw a Frame (Artboard)
Press F → choose frame size (e.g., iPhone 13, Desktop)

3. Add UI Elements
Use R for rectangle, T for text, O for circle

4. Create a Component

7. Share & Collaborate
Click “Share” → Generate link with permissions

Invite team members to view or edit

⚡ Tips & Tricks
💡 Design Tricks
Use Auto Layout to make responsive designs faster

Use Constraints to control how elements behave during resizing

Make Components for everything repeated

Use Variants to manage states (like buttons: hover, clicked)

Use Cmd/Ctrl \ to quickly swap instances

🔧 Productivity Tips
Use Shift + R to toggle rulers

Use Alt to measure spacing between elements

Use Cmd/Ctrl + G to group elements

Use Cmd/Ctrl + D to duplicate

Use smart selection: Hold Cmd/Ctrl + click to select overlapping items

🎨 Visual Tips
Stick to 8pt spacing system

Use consistent typography scale

Use plugin “Color Blind” to check accessibility

🔌 Best Plugins

🧠 Why Figma is Important in Software Development
Reason	Explanation
Collaborative Design	Designers, developers, PMs can all work together in real time
Faster Developer Handoff	Inspect tools give devs pixel-perfect details and code
Prototyping Without Code	Simulate user experience before building it
Design Consistency	Design systems and components ensure reuse and standardization
Version Control	Tracks changes, restores older versions
Cross-Platform	No installation needed—runs in browser
Feedback Loop	Easy commenting directly on the design

👨‍💻 Use Cases for Software Developers
Understand layout, spacing, and responsiveness before coding

Use CSS properties from Figma directly

Export assets (SVG, PNG) directly from designs

Collaborate with designers on design implementation

Avoid UI inconsistencies by following the design file exactly

🔚 Final Advice
Practice: Start by copying a real website UI into Figma to get comfortable

Stay Organized: Use naming conventions, pages, and folders

Design Responsively: Always test your UI for mobile, tablet, and desktop
