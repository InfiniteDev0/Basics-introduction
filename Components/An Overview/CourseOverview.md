4️⃣---------------------------------How They all connects --------------------------------->
     *Knowing these components separately is main but the purpose of this whole course is knowing how
      they connect and the things you can make when they connect , think of it as a puzzle, these 9 are the pieces , and with them you can make any puzzle u want.

                  Hardware contains the CPU which has the OS.
                                        |
                                        |
                  The Os runs code witten in a language from a Dev tool 
                                        |
                                        |
                  The hardware (monitor) displays the code results or error in the monitor
                                        |
                                        |
                  The displayed result is now the Frontend it allows user to interact
                                        |
                                        |
                  User interacts with Frontend and Does something 
                                        |
                                        |
                  The user request is sent to the Backend server using API's
                                        |
                                        |
                  The server recieves the request and processes it and talsk to the Db using API's       
                                        |
                                        |
                  The Db processes what the server needs
                                        |
                                        |
                  either (Store , Update , Retrieve , Delete)     
                                        |
                                        |
                  Db sends back the desired result to Server 
                                        |
                                        |
                  Server sends the result or the error to the frontend where the user sees it.
                                        |
                                        |
                  All of this is hosted in the cloud for everyone to see
                                        |
                                        |
                  Any changes to the Development phase has to be managed by using version control.
